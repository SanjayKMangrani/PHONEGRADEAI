Welcome to **PhoneGradeAI** – a personal project created for my portfolio to demonstrate how AI can be used to detect **damaged mobile phones** from images.

⚠️ **Note:** This is a hobby project and not intended for commercial or diagnostic use. It may not be accurate in real-world conditions.

---

### 📸 How to Use:
1. Take a clear photo of the **mobile phone screen** or find it from web.
2. Upload the image below (supported formats: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.jpeg`).
3. Click **"Check Condition"** to see if the phone is classified as **Good** or **Damaged**.
