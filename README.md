This project, PhoneGradeAI, demonstrates a practical AI-powered solution for assessing the condition of mobile phone screens (e.g., cracked vs. intact). It uses deep learning and computer vision techniques to classify images of phones into "Good" or "Damaged" categories based on the condition of the screen.

ðŸ”§ Real-World Application:
This solution can be adapted and embedded into real-world industrial settings, such as phone refurbishment or repair centers. By integrating this model with a camera sensor and a conveyor belt system, companies can automatically assess the physical condition of mobile phones at scale. This automation can significantly enhance quality control, speed up processing, and reduce manual inspection errors in high-volume repair facilities.
